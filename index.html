    <h1> Spring 2023 Anime Season Here!! </h1>
    <h1> What is an anime season? </h1>
    <p> While back in the old days of anime, episodes were released weekly for a series, sometimes spanning
        years, this has largely been phased out nowadays in exchange for an anime to have a set amount of 
    episodes instead. The episode count is traditionally 12-13 episodes for one cour, which lasts around 3
    months or a season, hence the seasonal names. </p>
